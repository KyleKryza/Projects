# Discord Bots

## Description
Here are some Discord bots I created from scratch in order to show real-time stock and crypto prices on their respective profile status. This allows for quick and easy access without having to open an extra tab.

## Skills Utilized
- Using different APIs to get stock and crypto data.
- Using Python to handle the data and format it correctly.
- Researching the Discord API in order to learn the library.
- Deploying and running these applications on AWS.

## Steps To Run
In order to run these files, you would need to create your own Discord bot and gain your own key. I would recommend just looking at the code as there is no quick method to run these files.
